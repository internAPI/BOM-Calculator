	- BOMCalcRevised Folder
		deprecated
			--> calc.php file is no longer being used
				--> reasoning: creates too much confusion logically, too scrambled when reading, and unorganize in general
				--> One page had all the functions which came be very overwhelming when reading it, compiling it, and debugging it
				--> Sort of approaching it in an OOD way, each $BOMUnit has there own computation, thus made separate files for each computation
			--> BomCalc.php || BomCalc2.php is no longer being used
				--> BomCalcRevised.php is the name for now. Can change the name to something more relevant when time comes
					--> extensive changes have been made as you read more below.
				--> Better to have a backup file off of something that works than to change the original and have a none-working file.	
				--> references pointing to Bomcalc.php || BomCalc2.php has been changed to BomCalcRevised.php
			--> As of 2/22/2019
				--> Computations Folder holding all $BOMUnitsComputations.php are no longer being used
				--> All $BOMUnits.php files are no longer being used
			
	
	- index.php
		BOM Calculator
			--> divided $BOMUnits into their own php files
				--> each unit had their own php computation files
				--> computation files are under one folder called Computations (deprecated as of 2/22/2019)
					--> $BOMUnitCompuation.php (deprecated as of 2/22/2019) was the name of each file
			--> reasoning: From the previous version, the if and else statements in the source code were running into one another thus creating errors that were not relevant

	- All the files
		Go To API link
			--> '<a href = "index.php">Go To API</a>'
			--> allows for user to go back to the API WEB TOOLS (index.php) page
		Go To Main Link (2/22/2019)
			--> changed 'Go To API' to Go To Main
		Indentation 
			--> moved around a lot of the source code to make it visually easier to read
			--> adjusted indents of the code
			--> Especially in the nested areas such as tables, if/else statements, nested html tags
		Comments
			--> added extensive comments to help reader understand the code and functionality
			--> commented most end brackets of if/else 
		Margin-left
			--> added margin 50px; 
			--> Just enough to not hug the left side of the page soo much. Give some cursor room

	- conversions.php (deprecated as of 2/22/2019) 
		Added Styling
			--> style = 'padding-top: 25px'
				--> creates better alignment with Value*: input field
			--> style="margin-top: 0%; margin: auto"
				--> Prevent any type of wrapping
				--> applied to the table 
					--> fixed position no matter how big/small the window size is
				--> added a div tag 
					--> style = 'width: 960px;' to help fixate the table
				--> applied to the second form tag
					--> form tag for the user inputs
					--> help keep this portion of the form fixated like the table regardless of the window size
		moved the Go To API href link below the header

	- corrlayouts.php
		Missing Body
			--> added the missing-paired body tag
		
	- rollength.php
		Radio checked
			--> implemented feature where if a radio button was selected, it would fill in the selected circle rather than disappearing
		ReDesign (2/22/2019)
			--> Redesigned the form submission action
			--> Instead of submitting to the process.php (deprecated as of 2/22/2019)
				--> the form will submit to itself
			--> PHP tags
				--> Will hold the respective echos and computations 
			--> added a dummy input that held an argument, which was hardcoded, to allow for a submissions to itself


	- $BOMUnit.php (deprecated as of 2/22/3019)
		autofocus
			--> feature that specifies that an <input> element should automatically get focus when the page loads
	
	- $BOMUnitCompuation.php (deprecated as of 2/22/2019)
		Creation
			--> created to separate the duties that were invovled
			--> this allows for a chance of resuability
		Go back link
			--> "<a href = 'javascript:history.go(-1)' style="padding-top: 30px"> Back to $BOMUnit </a>"
			--> allows user to go back to previous page without navigating back from selection of choices
		alert Error message
			--> creates a JS alert that lets user know an error occurred
			--> this alert will create a pop-up window that expains to user what went wrong
			--> This allows for resuability as well and less changes if needed
		Go TO API Link
			--> had to change the link from the directory above it: '../index.php'
			--> due to the fact that all computations were in a differnt folder
	
	- BOMCalcRevised.php, $BOMUnits.php (deprecated as of 2/22/2019), $BOMUnitsComputation.php (deprecated as of 2/22/2019)
		style.css
			--> <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
			--> linked the style.css file to the BOMCalcRevised
			--> looks cleaner when looking at source code

	- BOMCalcRevised.php
		"include" function
			--> links php files to the page when, in this instance, an action or condition was met
			--> This instance the $BOMUnit.php files were included
		Updated layout and redesigned. (2/22/2019)
			--> REMOVED THE INCLUDE FUNCTION!!
			--> Instead of the form submitting to somewhere else, the form can now submit to itself
			--> the PHP tags will have all the computations and echo statements. 
			--> All the computations and echos are within their respective functions
				--> Use of functions make the code cleaner and easier on the eyes. 
				--> Will add more comments as I tweak more and more
		Wish-List (2/22/2019)
			--> To make sure the functions and their formulas are correct
			--> Iterate through every use-case to assure there are minimized mistakes
			--> To ask around more about how others feel about the BOM calc


	- All Files except index.php
		method = "POST"
			--> some files had method - "GET"
			--> Changing from GET to POST is more secure. 
			--> POST hides it from the URL this mitigating an outsider to obtain any info about the code
		bolden 'other Resources'
			--> more aestheic than anything
			--> <b><p>Other Resources</p></b>

	- Conversions2.php
		redesign layout (2/22/2019)
			--> Similar to the BOM
				--> User will now have two drop down selections
					--> From unit
					--> To Unit
				--> Based on the two units the respective conversion will will appear
			--> Main difference is all the php is in one file
			--> Was able to design it so the page wouldn't have to reload to another page. 
				--> The form submitted to itself essentially
				--> This was done by adding a 'dummy' input that had a hard coded value which allowed for the $_POST to add it to the array when the form submitted
				--> This also gave gateway for the redesign of the BOMCalc and Roll Length calculator. 
				--> Though the bulk of the code is in one file, most of the code is within functions and are collapsable or expandable
					--> Are organized togather based on the function. 
					--> Much easier to read instead of opening x amount of files and trying to keep track of those files
				--> PURPOSE of redesign, to make easier and more userfriendly style. 
			--> Still considering about putting the previous chart in but i'm not sure 
			
	- All Files except index.php, boxlayout.php
		Accepting Decimal Inputs
			--> onChange='setDecimal(this)'step = '.001' 
				--> attributes have been added to the respective inputs that could potentially take in decimals
			--> function setDecimal(val) {val.value = parseFloat(val.value).toFixed(3);}
				--> inisde script tags and a function to allow the parsing of float values
			--> maxlength (2/22/2019)
				--> Increased the max length from 10 to 14
				--> compensate for the default decimal layout previously implemented
				--> More room for the whole number digits. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2/26/2019 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	- All Files
		Notes
			--> All newer notes will be updated from here on down.
			--> Above notes may still apply where needed
			--> All deprecated files will no longer apply
		NewFolder
			--> called RevisedBOMVersion2. This will store all of the updated changes and deprecated files and codes. 
			--> DeprecatedFiles Folder
				--> Stores all the deprecated files as of 2/26/2019
				--> includes all $BOMUnits Folder
					--> Contains all $BOMUnits files
				--> $BOMUnitsComputations Folder
					--> Contains all $BOMUnitsComputation files 
				--> concalc.php
				--> conversions.php
				--> process.php
					--> This was the computations for the RollLength.php page
		BOMCalcRevised.php
			--> Specifically in BOM for LBS
				--> previous formula was incorrect
				--> ((web * 12) / yield) * 1000 is the updated formula as of 2/26/2019
				--> included the DummyPHP.php 
					--> This name will be changed later
				--> Implemented the allowance of more than one yield.
				--> The need for the DummyyPHP.php was a necessity in order to carry out this task
					--> reasoning... There confusion of single and double quotations could not allow the compiler to be error-free
			--> BOM for MTR
				--> Added a new BOM selection that would allow for MTR (Meters)
		href Back to Main
			--> removed the text-decoration on all files
	- Wish List (2/26/2019)
		keep Form contents when going back
			--> the form once submitted goes away and thus removing all contents when going back
			--> try to keep the form info when even after submitted
		Multiple Conversions
			--> Conversions2.php 
				--> Would like to implement that does multiple conversions at once instead of one at a time
				--> perhaps to do this we change the onchange='this.form.submit();' t othe first then the next drop down selection will have the appropriate conversion units (removes the a-like ones)
				--> this would make multiple conversions a possibility
		responsive and active sidebar
			--> perhaps a side bar that is easily accessible. Feel like the footer links are not as used. Personally that is
				--> For others that's exactly where they might like it. 
		Color
			--> perhaps a bit more styling and coloring. I'm just dancing around the idea at the moment
---------------------------------------------------------- 03/07/2019 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	-Conversions2.php
		font-size	
			--> increased the font size from default to 20px;
			--> changed on buttons
				--> Calculate and Clear
---------------------------------------------------------- 03/08/2019 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	-BOMCalcRevised.php, Conversions2.php
		Selected Options -- Disabled/Selected
			--> Implemented a feature that would allow dropdown menu to stay selected once user had picked the choice;
			--> Specifically in Conversions2.php
				--> Based on user unit to convert from, the respective units to convert to would be non-disabled and disabled
					--> I.E ---> if user needed to go from M ... LFT, LYDS, MSI, LBS would be allowed to selection while M and METERS are DISABLED
			Resolved First WishList from (02/26/2019)
				--> The selection buttons will stay selected after selects them. 
	-BOMCalcRevised.php, Conversions2.php, RollLength.php, correlayouts.php
		'Back to Main'
			--> Added some arrows to indicate going back
			--> &laquo;&laquo;'Back to Main'
		'Back'
			Same as 'Back to Main'
			--> &laquo;&laquo; 'Back'
		Headers
			--> Added feature where the headers could be clicked to refresh the page
---------------------------------------------------------- 03/15/2019 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	-BOMCalcRevised.php, Conversions2.php
		No More Alert
			--> Implemented a function that would negate the alert pop-up message stating what the error was
			--> Now the page won't load unless the proper input is given. 
			--> Conversions2.php
				--> All fields must contain a value
				--> If the value is zero, then the input will not be accept
			--> BOMCalcRevised.php
				--> Same thing
		Tabular Design
			--> BagsAndPouchesPage.php
				--> combined the Wicket/Box/Zipper page into one called Bags and Pouches BOM
			--> User can enter various combinations to get a result, yet certain ones won't produce a result
				--> i.e if all are empty or zero, the page will not load the result
				--> i.e if either repeat or strips is empty while the others are filled
			--> In conversions2.php
				--> units coverting with 5 inputs, changed to more of a list-like view rather than side by side. 
				--> This was change due to the fact if the window was resized to be smaller, the display would wrap and thus cause confusion. 
		AutoComplete='off'
			--> There is no autocomplete on the inputs. This could was the autocomplete drop-down to overlap the other inputs. 
			--> Initially, the reason for display the inputs and labels in one row was to negate the autocomplete overlap, but due to the design and the window sizing difference, 
				--> the best idea was to just remove autocomplete as a whole
	-BOMCalcRevised.php
		--> LBSPage.php
			--> extensive changes
			--> Tabular layout
				--> More like a list style for inputs and labels
			--> 'Add Film'
				--> button that will add yield or film when clicked
			--> Film/Yield ++
				--> Every time the user clicks the 'Add Film' another display of inputs will be accepted for the user to input
			--> 'Remove Film'
				--> button that removes the film that is respective to its yield
				--> i.e --> if user removes film 4, yield/film 4 will be removed
					--> and So on
				--> MUST REMOVE the most recent added film first

		--> Contains new Files
			--> RollLengthCalculator.php
			--> RolllengthComputations.php
			--> RollLengthFootageFilled.php
			--> RollLengthOutDiamFilled.php
		--> The layout was mimicked from the HandyMath's website 
			--> http://www.handymath.com/cgi-bin/rollenApp4.cgi 
			--> The warehouse workers seemed to be using this more and I just wanted to make something that they were used to seeing and hopefully will be using
	- RollLengthCalculator.php
		--> More refined and cleaner layout than the original
		--> Calculations are verified
		--> User input is verified
		--> Visually more appealing
	- All Files
		--> All files background has changed from #ffffff to #FFFAF0

		--> Changed the '<<<< Back to Main' link text color to #000; 
			--> With a bold weight and a slight blue background to it
	- RollLengthComputations.php
		--> This is all the backend code. for all the computations
		--> Will not have a radio button like the previous one did
			--> can implement if needed, but Justin from the warehouse didn't like that layout
			--> Too many clicks to get to where you wanted... navigation wasn't user-friendly
		--> Perform calculations such as footage or/and estimated weight or outside diamter. 
			--> cannot perform footage, estimated weight and outside diamter simultaneously, 
				--> Only footage/estimated weight or outside diamter. 
		--> input validation is performed to prevent buffer overflow, injection attacks
			--> inputs will have a  max length  that can be allowed which is 15 characters
			--> Inputs will only be Numbers, nothing alphabetical or alphanumeric. 
		--> Will have the same checks and conditions like the previous rolllength
		--> Much cleaner and organized source code ... using functions rather than ifs-elses thrown here and there
			--> More of an OOD style like in Java
	- RollLengthFootageFilled.php
		--> Table-form of the answers the user had previously input
		--> The table will change depending if the is looking for Estimated weight
		--> This table is for results only
		--> cannot make amends
		--> Takes the PHP back end results and pushes it into the table for results. 
		--. has a 'Go Back Button'
	- RollLengthOutDiamFilled.php
		--> Similar to the RollLengthFootageFilled.php
		--> Only displays results
		--> User cannot change the results unless he/she hit's the 'Go Back' button

			--> All SOP files for each part of the Website will go here. 
			--> Will eventually have to keep updating
		--> Styles
			--> any and all CSS styles that are used go into this file
	Goals:
		--> Create Cleaner code
			--> CSS should be external and !inline
			--> More organization
		--> Verify any and all computations
		--> Talk to Arron, Tina, Danielle, and anybody else needed to get more feedback
--------------------------------------------------------04/02/2019--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Styles
		RollengthCalclatorStyle.css
		IndexStyle.css
		Conversion2Style.css
